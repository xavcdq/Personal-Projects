## 1. Airbnb Availability & Revenue Optimisation - Power BI Project
This project explores the Airbnb listings dataset in New York with the goal of reducing availability to indirectly increase host revenue in under-performing districts. Using Power BI, I analysed availability patterns and built a scenario-based What-If analysis to simulate changes in price and review quality. 
The objective is to identify strategies to reduce excess listing availability - particularly in the two districts with the highest number of available units (Staten Island and Bronx) - by adjusting controllable levers such as price and 5-star review count.
